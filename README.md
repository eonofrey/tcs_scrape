# Scraping Store Addresses from The Container Store's Website

This short script scrapes and cleans the addresses for all of The Container Store's stores. It outputs a .csv file with 1 column, the address. 


The Company's main site has all of the store locations displayed on the main page. Clicking each store sends you to an individual page for that store
